The goal of this project is to consume the APIs presented in the Angelcam documentation to display live videos and recordings made available in the account registered with Angelcam. I used two technologies widely adopted by many corporations: Django and React. With Django, I used and customized the provided APIs, including adding access tokens. With React, I consumed these APIs and built the application template.
